# Mbunity Assessment Test

To start project instal all dependencies with npm or yarn and type
`yarn start` or `npm run start`
Completed task using **vite** with such technologies as:

- ract js
- react-hook-form +yup (for validate form)
- typescript, scss modules
- husky, eslint, prettier, lint-staged

**deploy link (Vercel)** - [Mbunity Assessment Test](https://mbunity-assessment-test-3ehp.vercel.app/),

What is done:

- add functionality to form
- add header links, which now can easily be scaled and prepared for routing
- burger menu without libraries
- pixel perfect web design
- reusable UI components (button, Input field, Select)
- several issues were in figma, but i resolved them in my way.

if it was a full site, not a single page, I would probably use the MUI library, with a custom theme.
